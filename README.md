# Bayesian-Decision-Theory
Introduction Bayesian decision theory is a fundamental statistical approach to the problem of pattern classification. It is considered the ideal case in which the probability structure underlying the categories is known perfectly. While this sort of stiuation rarely occurs in practice, it permits us to determine the optimal (Bayes) classifier against which we can compare all other classifiers. Moreover, in some problems it enables us to predict the error we will get when we generalize to novel patterns. This approach is based on quantifying the tradeoffs between various classification decisions using probability and the costs that accompany such decisions. It makes the assumption that the decision problem is posed in probabilistic terms, and that all of the relevant probability values are known.
